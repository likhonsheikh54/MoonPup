## üöÄ Our Story

Before humans took their giant leap, brave pups blazed the trail to the stars. MOONPUP celebrates these pioneering pooches who strapped on their tiny helmets and ventured into the cosmos, all wagging tails and wide eyes. It's not just a coin; it's a tribute to the first four-legged moonwalkers who proved that even the sky isn't the limit when you've got enough fur and courage.

As the first DeepSeek AI meme token on-chain, we're carrying forward that legacy of canine courage into the crypto space, creating a community as boundless as space itself.
